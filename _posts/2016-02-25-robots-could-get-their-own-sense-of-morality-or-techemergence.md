description: 'In his 1942 short story Runaround, science fiction writer Issac Asimov introduced "the three laws of robotics." The laws were designed to provide a set of simple morals to guide advanced artificial intelligence. In reality, it has been argued that we are not even close to creating robots that could even comprehend such rules, but this may be about to change.'
